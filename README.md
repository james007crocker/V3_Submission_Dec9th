#CS 3307 Team Project Version 3.0 12/07/2015

-------------------------------------------

##What is this?

 - The goal of this project was to create a program to easily display and summarize the work of faculty and staff at the London Health Sciences Center. Currently, all this data is recorded in a massive multi-line excel file, despite not many of these staff members having the ability to maipulate data in excel. Using a simple minimal button user interface, this group of 10 students was able to reduce what could have been a multi-hour task into under a minute. In addition to building many of the data-structures for this project, I held the role of project manager.
